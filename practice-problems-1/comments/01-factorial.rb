# Write a method that takes an integer `n` in; it should return
# n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1. Assume n >= 0.
#
# As a special case, `factorial(0) == 1`.
#
# Difficulty: easy.

def factorial(n) #this is a recursive solution
  if n <= 1                       #break case. When this condition is met, the recusion stops.
    return 1
  end
 return n * factorial(n - 1)       #so this keeps layering like this: 5*(4*(3*(2*(1))))
end           # 5! == 5*4*3*2*1 == 120


# These are tests to check that your code is working. After writing
# your solution, they should all print true.
