# Write a method that takes in a number and returns true if it is a
# power of 2. Otherwise, return false.
#
# You may want to use the `%` modulo operation. `5 % 2` returns the
# remainder when dividing 5 by 2; therefore, `5 % 2 == 1`. In the case
# of `6 % 2`, since 2 evenly divides 6 with no remainder, `6 % 2 == 0`.
#
# Difficulty: medium.

def is_power_of_two?(num)
    powers = (1..100).to_a.map{|i| i = i**2}      #create an array of powers upto 100

        if powers.include?(num)                   #if the num is included into the powers
            return true 
        end

    return false
end
#^^^^This is bad, but it works lol


# These are tests to check that your code is working. After writing
# your solution, they should all print true.
