#  Solutions to App Academy problems
*I got accepted into App Academy. This repo is full of my solutions to the various prep problems provided by [a/A](https://www.appacademy.io/).*


#### I didn't complete all of them, so some questions won't be in this repo!!!!!!

I spent 1.5 years getting into a/A. The journey was long but I'm happy to say that I was accepted into a/A August 2018. However, since I don't have the money, I probably wonâ€™t attend.
Despite that, I hope this helps future a/A applicants or whomever in their code journey.


##  Commented and Uncommented versions

I would comment a lot in order to better understand what the program was doing. These comments could be a total eyesore to some, so I made uncommented versions ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

###  Hopefully it helps!


##  Note:

For about 4 months I didn't understand ruby and ruby logic. So I took a course in JavaScript on Udemy to build foundations. I attribute a lot of my success to this step. *If youâ€™re really struggling, I suggest you do the same!!*

**Course:**  [The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/share/1001cQ/)
*^^I was about 38%, around section 15, into the course before I moved on to a/A's problems.*

After the course I would suggest going through some of these [ruby coding videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgYiyoyNPrv_UhCfDLOT8yZPmVeOFjqGH). At least 20 videos. *Not just the easy ones!!*    

In regards to **test-first-ruby-master**, you should use this for when you're stuck. Ex: you solved some parts but a certain part is tripping you up. These don't have comments.
